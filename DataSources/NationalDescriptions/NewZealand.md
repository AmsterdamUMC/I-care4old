## Data contents

* interRAI data (sample sizes for 2014–2018)
    - Home care (HC): 110,107 persons
    - Long-term care (LTC): 61,373 persons
    - Instrument versions: interRAI Suite 9.1 to 9.3 (HC), interRAI Suite 9.3 (LTC)
    - Medication information: not collected

The New Zealand data are controlled by the New Zealand Ministry of Health. The data cover the years 2014–2021 and are collected electronically using interRAI instruments (versions 9.1 to 9.3 in home care and 9.3 in long-term care). The data are collected at admission and every 6 to 12 months in home care and every 3 months in long-term care. The data collection is well distributed across regions, and the LTC data covers approximately 7% of 65 years old persons receiving care in the country. The New Zealand RAI data cannot be linked to external events.

## Data collection

New Zealand interRAI data from home care and long-term care clients are collected by health professionals in a structured conversation with the client. The data, together with demographic and clinical information is stored using a laptop and a care software provided by specialized companies. The interRAI data are stored electronically at the interRAI New Zealand office (warehouse).

## Linkage and pseudonymisation
 
Before the data set is given to the researchers, personal information, such as name and address, are removed from the data set by the TAS system under Te Whatu Ora Health New Zealand. Thus, anonymized data containing demographic, clinical, and social variables are used by researchers. The TAS system provides the MBUN (meaningless but unique number) that is used to combine the records from different care settings based on the needs of each project.

## Data security

Data from New Zealand are sent to interRAI through a previously established contractual arrangement between interRAI and the governments of these two countries. New Zealand is responsible for the transfer of data to the University of Waterloo. They provided a secure portal, and the data will be downloaded from there directly onto the University of Waterloo secure server. All other secure protocols are the same as for Canadian unlinked data.

## Legal basis for use

New Zealand governments assumes responsibility of de-identifying personal information. Only de-identified (anonymised) data is transmitted to interRAI for research purposes. The use of these fully anonymised data is compliant with EU ethics and legal frameworks (data will not be linked with other sources, so no further ethical approval is needed). The legal basis for secondary use of data from New Zealand is an annually renewed agreement between I-CARE4OLD collaborators Hebrew Senior Life and University of Waterloo and health authorities from these jurisdictions. Hebrew SeniorLife is the official repository for all Home Care data; this includes data from other countries that submit de-identified data to Hebrew SeniorLife in compliance with an agreement between InterRAI and each respective country (including New Zealand). University of Waterloo also receives copies of the New Zealand data, this is covered by secondary analysis clearance 'ORE 30173 Secondary data analysis of information collected using interRAI instruments'. Valid until Sept 2024, renewable.
