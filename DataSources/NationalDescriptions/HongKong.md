## Data controller

Social Welfare Department of Hong Kong, University of Waterloo

## Data contents

* interRAI data (sample size for 2016–2018)
    - Home care (HC): 35,562 persons
    - Instrument version: MDS 2.0
    - Medication information: free text entry

The data cover the years 2016–2019. The data are collected electronically at admission in home care, using MDS 2.0 instruments. The Hong Kong interRAI data cannot be linked to external events.

## Data collection

In Hong Kong, interRAI for home care and long-term care data are collected by trained assessors (nurses, social workers, and therapists) in different Hong Kong districts (Shatin District of New Territories, Central/Western District, and Southern District).

## Linkage and pseudonymisation

The data are stored at the Social Welfare Department of Hong Kong, and datasets are transferred from that institution to the researchers and students per research demand and needs. Prior to release, identifying information has been removed from the datasets and a privacy review was conducted to make sure that combinations of variables could not be used to re-identify a person. Home care and long-term care data were anonymised separately. Only home care data is available in the study period 2016–2019.

## Data security

Data from Hong Kong are sent to interRAI through a previously established contractual arrangement between interRAI and the governments of these two countries. Hong Kong is responsible for the transfer using the University of Waterloo Secure transfer service. All other secure protocols are the same as for Canadian unlinked data.

## Legal basis for use

Hong Kong government assumes responsibility of de-identifying personal information. Only de-identified (anonymised) data is transmitted to interRAI for research purposes. The use of these fully anonymised data is compliant with EU ethics and legal frameworks (data will not be linked with other sources, so no further ethical approval is needed). The legal basis for secondary use of data from Hong Kong is an annually renewed agreement between I-CARE4OLD collaborators Hebrew Senior Life and University of Waterloo and health authorities from these jurisdictions. Hebrew SeniorLife is the official repository for all Home Care data; this includes data from other countries that submit de-identified data to Hebrew SeniorLife in compliance with an agreement between InterRAI and each respective country (including Hong Kong). University of Waterloo also receives copies of the Hong Kong data, this is covered by secondary analysis clearance 'ORE 30173 Secondary data analysis of information collected using interRAI instruments'. Valid until Sept 2024, renewable.
