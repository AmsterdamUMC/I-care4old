## Data contents

* interRAI data (sample sizes for 2014–2018)
    - Home care (HC): 2,634,080 persons
    - Long-term care (LTC): 2,157,535 persons
    - Instrument versions: MDS 2.0 and interRAI Suite 9, MDS 3.0 (only LTC)

* Non-pharmacological interventions (LTC only)

The data cover the years 2014–2018 and are collected electronically using MDS 2.0 and interRAI Suite 9 for home care, and MDS 2.0, MDS 3.0 and interRAI Suite 9 for long-term care (nursing homes). The home care data are collected semi-annually, and the long-term care data are collected quarterly. For home care data, USA is able to link hospital visits to RAI data. For long-term care data, they are able to link hospital visits, deaths, medication events, non-pharmacological events and change of care events. The events come from CMS (hospital, death, and change of care), CDW (non-pharmacological and change of care), and DMS Pharmaceutical (medication events).

## Data collection

### Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [CMS.GOV] US Nursing Home Long Term MDS

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), previously known as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and health insurance portability standards. In addition to these programs, CMS has other responsibilities, including the administrative simplification standards from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), quality standards in long-term care facilities (more commonly referred to as nursing homes) through its survey and certification process, clinical laboratory quality standards under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, and oversight of HealthCare.gov. CMS manages the uploading of Long-Term Care MDS3 data from each skilled nursing facility in the United State, which includes all 50 states.

### interRAI [National & International data]

As an organization, interRAI maintains high standards for the quality of measures used in our instrument systems. Each version of a system represents the results of rigorous research and testing to establish the reliability and validity of items, outcome measures, assessment protocols, case-mix algorithms, and quality indicators. We encourage and financially support ongoing research efforts by the Fellows of the corporation to improve the usefulness of our tools in a systematic fashion.  Fellows also assist to translate our instruments into their native languages, making the interRAI suite a truly global resource. The interRAI data is sent to the interRAI data management team, who are responsible for any data management, data cleaning and data distribution.

## Data security

Margaret Bryan, data analyst at Hebrew SeniorLife and data analyst for the project is responsible for secure storage and transfer of data. All data are backed up to present accidental data loss. Hebrew SeniorLife adheres to all guidelines and requirements established by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) and adheres to guidelines and requirements established by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). I-CARE4OLD data is safely stored in trusted repositories operated and maintained by Hebrew SeniorLife and the Marcus Institute for Aging Research. The repositories are protected by extensive firewalls to maintain safety and enable long term preservation.

## Legal basis for use

The data are collected through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) during clinical care. Two contractual agreements are in place: 1) For data from home care users, InterRAI has an agreement with each state in the US where interRAI is being used, whereby the states have the right to use the IP associated with the Home Care tool in exchange for receipt of de-identified (anonymised) Home Care data. Hebrew SeniorLife receives the data and serves as repository in the US. 2) For nursing home data, CMS sends only de-identified (fully anonymised) data to researchers following a formal application, review and purchase. CMS sends only de-identified (fully anonymised) data to researchers following a formal application, review and purchase. Through a rigorous application process and detailed review by CMS, data was purchased by Hebrew SeniorLife (researchers) for the purpose of completing analyses for this project.

## Data re-use

In the US, nursing home data is obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS). Obtaining the data requires an extensive application process and payment. CMS then sends completely de-identified data to the Hebrew SeniorLife Data Analyst, Margaret Bryan, who maintains responsibility for access and storage. An i-cloud account is used to store the data protected by the firewall systems utilized by the Marcus Institute for Aging Research at Hebrew SeniorLife.

The home care dataset consists of de-identified computerized records of the interRAI Home Care assessments provided to the not-for-profit interRAI collaborative by government agencies. Responsibility for storage, safety and access of the data rests with Margaret Bryan, data analyst for Hebrew SeniorLife on this project.
