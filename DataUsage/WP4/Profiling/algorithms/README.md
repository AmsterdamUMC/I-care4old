## Name of algorithm

Profility Profiling Prediction Method

## Purpose of algorithm

The profiling method main purpose is to predict with high accuracy, taking into account a larger number of predictive variables, and without the need to define how each variable is merged with the prediction logic. That means, once you allow the algorithm to read a patient data file and to point out for predictive variables that are included as part of the patientsâ€™ characteristics that are available, a predictive model will be set. It will be set without feeding the method with the role of each variable, whether it is or it is not participating, and what part is it taking when it is part of the logic. Potentially you can also include variables that do not continue much or used only in some cases, and the method will get arranged and be prepared for prediction task. When used for new and unknown research or commercial challenges, the method shows the potential to add prediction application without much effort and with accuracy that is satisfying, as presented along the project.

## Work package responsible

The profiling prediction module is part of the WP4, managed by HSL as a leader of WP4 and with Profility supporting the WP4 portion to support and add a second method for prediction

## Related deliverable

Replicating prediction analysis done by the HSL WP4 team, in a different way, to allow establish confidence having both method point to similar performance as well as allow a base to potentially conclude that we can continue and build future prediction projects in a similar way and with less manual work, open the door for commercial applications and more research.

The validation of the HSL WP4 analysis was prepared for 6 questions of research and was shared with the team (see separate slide deck)

A user interface was set to show how patient data as input result in a prediction that could support decision makes when facing care planning to prevent persons from negative health events.

## Main creator

Profility Ltd.  is a commercial company dedicated for developing solutions for profiling patients that are coming out of acute episode and are transitioned for further steps along the continuum of care, rehabilitation, nursing, etc. The company entered the Horizon project and created a profiling method that fits the targets definitions of the full project, customizing the prediction process and overseeing the entire needs of the different WPs.

## Creation date

The profiling method was created mostly during the first 2 years of this Horizon project, validated and fine tuned during the entire project.

## License

No use of any external license was used on the WP4 profiling part, but the C++ program.
