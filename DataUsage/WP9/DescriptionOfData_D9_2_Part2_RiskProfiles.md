### Short Description of Data Contents, Analysis Purpose, and Methods
This study focuses on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on **frailty, cognitive function, and mortality risk** among **long-term care (LTC) residents in Canada**. It utilizes data from the **interRAI Minimum Data Set 2.0 (MDS 2.0)**.

#### Objectives
1. **Assess frailty progression** among LTC residents before and during COVID-19.
2. **Investigate cognitive decline trends** and their associations with key risk factors.
3. **Estimate mortality risk** using survival models and hazard ratios.

## Data Processing

### Sample Restrictions
- **Frailty model**: LTC residents aged 65+ with at least one frailty assessment before and during COVID-19.
- **Cognitive function model**: LTC residents with at least two cognitive assessments.
- **Mortality risk model**: Residents with complete follow-up data.

### Major Recodings or Transformations Applied
- **Categorization of frailty scores** into mild, moderate, and severe.
- **Cognitive performance grouped** by Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR).
- **Survival status** tracked using mortality indicators.

### Handling of Missing Values
- **Excluded cases with more than 20% missing data** for key variables.

### Methods Used in Each Analysis Phase
#### 1. Frailty Progression Analysis
- **Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)** for repeated measures.
- Covariates: age, sex, pre-existing conditions, facility factors.

#### 2. Cognitive Decline Trends
- **Mixed-effects regression models** to track changes in cognition.
- Adjustments for baseline cognitive status and comorbidities.

#### 3. Mortality Risk Estimation
- **Cox proportional hazards model** for survival analysis.
- **Kaplan-Meier survival curves** comparing pre- and post-pandemic mortality rates.
